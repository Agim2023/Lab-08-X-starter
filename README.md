# Lab 08-X

The purpose of this lab is to help you practice using your editor and do a little review with JavaScript.

You will practice using shortcut keys to help you work more quickly.

You should also work with two windows side-by-side: VSCode on the left and Chrome on the right. This way, when you run live-server, whenever you save with Control-S, you can see your changes pop up on the right side of your screen.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your computer or use Codespaces.
2. Navigate to your repository, and open VSCode and live-server.
3. Set up your two windows side-by-side: VSCode on the left and Chrome on the right.
4. Practice your workflow of work, save, and view results so you can have a tight circle of response to each change you make.
5. After each page you complete, commit to git.
6. Be sure to use the keyboard shortcuts in this Lab.
